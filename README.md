
Certainly! Here's a sample README.md for a GitHub repository for a puzzle solver application using the brick library in Haskell:

Haskell Puzzle Solver
Overview
This Haskell Puzzle Solver is a command-line application built using the brick library. The goal of this project is to provide a versatile and extensible platform for solving various puzzles interactively through the terminal. While the initial focus will be on Sudoku, the architecture is designed to accommodate additional puzzle types in the future.

Features
Sudoku Solver: The application starts with a Sudoku puzzle solver, allowing users to input a puzzle and receive a solved solution.

Interactive Interface: Utilizing the brick library, the application provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for solving puzzles. Users can navigate through cells, input values, and visualize the solution dynamically.

Extensibility: The project is designed with extensibility in mind. The codebase allows for easy integration of new puzzle types, making it a potential hub for various logic puzzles.
